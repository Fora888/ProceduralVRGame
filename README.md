# ProceduralVRGame
Currently it's just a randomly generated map with some rocks and a player who can walk through it. I recently added an Inventory and the ability to pick up Items, but there is still work to do like throwing and polishing the "UI"
Things I want to add:
- Building: It's going to consist of drawing basic 3D shapes from one point to another like for example cylinders
- More complex world generation: Simply add more octaves to noise and modulate noise with noise
- Tree generation
- Probably some factory game elements

Made with Unity 2020.2.1f1
